Digital Twin research focuses on creating virtual replicas of physical systems, processes, or objects that enable real-time simulation, monitoring, and analysis. By integrating data from sensors, IoT devices, and advanced analytics, digital twins provide a dynamic, data-driven approach to understanding and optimizing complex systems. My research centers on leveraging Digital Twin technology for system design, performance optimization, and lifecycle management, with an emphasis on enhancing decision-making and predictive capabilities. Through the integration of AI, machine learning, and real-time data, I aim to develop innovative solutions that bridge the gap between physical and digital domains, driving efficiency and innovation in engineering and beyond.
