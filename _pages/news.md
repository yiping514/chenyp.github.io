Yi-Ping's paper, titled "Real-Time Decision-Making for Digital Twin in Additive Manufacturing with Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Neural Networks", was considered a high-quality work, and was recommended by the Scientific Committee of NAMRC 53 for fast-tracking to Journal of Manufacturing Systen! 

From historical stats, only less than 20 papers would be fast-tracked to Journal of Manufacturing Systems/Journal of Manufacturing Process. It is a great honor!
