Yi-Ping and Gourav wins First Place in the 2025 ASME IDETC-CIE Student Hackathon
==========

> Aug. 16, 2025

Yi-Ping and Gourav teamed up to win the 2025 ASME IDETC-CIE Student Hackathon on the ntop problem. The performance is evaluated based on surrogate model accuracy, inverse design quality, and technical presentations. They fully utilized the active learning perspective in both sampling and optimization, allowing the design window to be shrinked and identify a better design.

Yi-Ping's co-authored paper is selected as one of the 10 "Paper of Distinction" by the Design Automation Conference (DAC) in 2025 ASME IDETC-CIE!
=========

> Aug. 16, 2025

Yi-Ping's co-authored paper, led by Dr. Ying-Kuan Tsai titled "Multi-Generation Control Co-Design for Digital Twin-Enabled Systems With Deep Reinforcement Learning", was selected as one of the 10 "Paper of Distinction" out of 108 submissions. 



Yi-Ping completed the Management for Ph.D. Certificate Program offered by The Graduate School at Northwestern and Kellogg School of Management!
=========

> Aug. 05, 2025

The Graduate School has partnered with the Kellogg School of Management to offer a certificate program taught by Kellogg faculty that will equip promising post-candidacy doctoral students with the necessary business and leadership skills such as managing and leading teams and budgets, communicating with business-oriented colleagues, and surmounting the hurdles associated with the commercialization of research. This program offers doctoral students to expose to these situations before entering academia or other industries. Yi-Ping was very lucky to get admitted and finished the program. This will be a huge plus to his mentorship, managing skills, and diverse experience.
